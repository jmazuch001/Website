                            <p>I have been learning web and software development for the last two and a half years, learning everything from front-end to back-end development. 
                                I am ready to begin looking for opportunities in web development, very flexible for starting out and open to almost any location!
                                I have a diverse enducational background and have worked on various front-end projects and have no problem using all of my skills
                                to accomplish a task. My projects are available for review on my GitHub, as well as my portfolio page to this website. I have 
                                made it easy to access my GitHub by clicking on my assortment of projects, as well as a link in the navigation bar. 
                                <div class="title-underline bg-danger underline-shadow"></div>
                              </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                I left manufacturing in good graces and started in corrections, where I would 
                                ultimately be able to fund all of my learning in web development. I had considered going into cybersecurity,
                                but believe that I'd rather engineer other solutions for the time being. While in corrections, I was welcomed
                                into a family of officers, realizing that we had each other's back. It's undeniable that it was a formidable 
                                environment, but sticking to policy was often the best method and it taught me the value of having clarity in 
                                certain areas where one's own judgement wasn't appropriate. The biggest impact it had on me was gaining the respect
                                of not only my co-workers, but also that of the inmate population. I used motivational psychology and a professional,
                                objective approach whenever possible and it turned out to be a personal policy I'd come to enforce, too. In the 
                                 meantime, it gave me time to spend with my parents after being away for college for almost eight years.
                                 <div class="title-underline bg-danger underline-shadow"></div>
                              </p>
                            <p>
                                I am an alarmingly fast learner, and, not limited to my Bachelor of Science in Psychology, I first started learning web development at the 
                                beginning of 2017 using TeamTreehouse, completing the "How to Make A Basic Web Page" track, and diving deeper into the individual 
                                technologies henceforth. It really helped shape my understanding of web technologies throughout, including my own usage of Bootstrap. 
                                Last year, I was awarded the Grow With Google Front-End Developer Scholarship through Google and Udacity. Growing up around 
                                computers and having an eye for art and detail also helps me exercise my creativity, allowing me to create a UX-oriented, 
                                aesthetically pleasing, responsive design. Since then, I have added HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, jQuery, 
                                Node.js, JSON, Git/Git Bash, Python and MySQL to my repertoire (plus many, many others) and am eager to get to work! I also have 
                                a number of apps hosted on Heroku (link will be provided upon request). 
                                <div class="title-underline bg-danger underline-shadow"></div>
                              </p>
                            <p>
                                I enjoy figuring things out on my own, but realize that there can be time constraints. I'm the type of hard worker that will 
                                have the tendency to do research in my off-time after work, come back the next day and solve the problem - or I'll ask for input. 
                                The importance of production and churning out quality results is highly important to me, as I don't like others to be waiting on me. 
                                Given my passion for working with technology, I am quite confident that my skills can best aid in a Web Developer. I am eager to 
                                start showing what I've got and giving back to others who are making their way, helping out in the community or at University. 
                                In all of my job history, I am proud to say that my reliability, work ethic, and dedication always show a strong trend, and am 
                                fortunate to have heard so from supervisors. If you have any questions, please feel free to use the means of contact which I have 
                                provided throughout my website.
